# [Project] Defence System
## Problem Description of Defence System 
Please design a neural net to predict network intrusion types for the datasets 
“train_DefenseSystem.csv” and “test_DefenseSystem.csv.” Please read the dataset 
description in the file “DefenseSystem_Readme.docx.”

Requirement:
- Randomly select 80% of the training set as your training set and the rest 20% as your validation set.
- Use the validation set to design your network structure and choose possible hyper-parameters 
- try 3 different network structures at least and list all the parameters you may use.
- Use your best network (out of 3 at least) to predict the intrusion type for the test set.
## Requirements:
- torch==1.10.0+cu102
- numpy==1.22.4 
- scikit-learn==1.1.1
- pandas==1.4.2 

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
