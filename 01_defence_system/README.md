# Problem Description of Defence System 
Please design a neural net to predict network intrusion types for the datasets 
“train_DefenseSystem.csv” and “test_DefenseSystem.csv.” Please read the dataset 
description in the file “DefenseSystem_Readme.docx.”

Randomly select 80% of the training set as your training set and the rest 20% 
as your validation set. Use the validation set to design your network structure and 
choose possible hyper-parameters 
(try 3 different network structures at least and list all the parameters you may use). 

Use your best network (out of 3 at least) to predict the intrusion type for the 
test set.
